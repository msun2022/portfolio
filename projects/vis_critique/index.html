				<strong>Insights about the data/visualization:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The number of new covid cases seems to ebb and flow 
					without a strong general directional trend (i.e. 
					consistently increasing or consistently decreasing).
				</li>
				<li>
					New covid cases seem to come in "waves" in which there 
					are periods of time of large amounts of new covid cases.
				</li>
				<li>
					The first major wave is around the start of 2021 
					(December 2020 - January 2021). The next major wave is 
					around August to September of 2021. The third wave is 
					the most recent Omnicron outbreak happening at the start 
					of 2022.
				</li>
				<li>
					It seems that the recent Omnicron outbreak will generate 
					the largest wave of new Covid cases.
				</li>
				<li>
					The number of new cases in June 2021 was parituclarly low.
				</li>
			</ul>

				<strong>Design Critique:</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Ignoring the intriguing spiral design for the time dimension, 
				many of the design choices seem to be quite effective in 
				making the visualization readable. Firslty, I appreciated 
				a lot of the labeling and minor design choices. Each year is 
				labeled near the January axis with an arrow to make clear 
				both the direction of time in this chart and where to start 
				reading (i.e., the center). The 7-day average label is 
				a nice detail for us to know, although maybe it could be 
				included in the title as well. I also believe that the legend 
				is trying to communicate that a linear scale is being used, 
				since the 0 becomes 150k via straight lines,
				although this is not super clear (ideally this should 
				be made explicit). Using width to represent the measure of 
				interest is a good idea, given that the time dimension must 
				use up the whole plane's dimensionality. Also, the solid 
				border adds visibility and emphasizes the width of the 
				spiraling curve. Lastly, the specific measure of choice, 
				7-day rolling averages, is an intelligent choice that 
				eliminates weekly periodicity and random noise, so that we 
				are mainly exposed to trends over large periods.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the choice of this spiral design is a little bit 
				confusing and suspicious to me. It does have some symbolic 
				significance by placing 2020 in the center of the spiral, 
				sort of communicating that this was the "origin" of the 
				pandemic. Also, it still doesn't lose the directionality 
				of time given the effective labeling, and it also allows for 
				us to see if there is any intrayear seasonality, although I 
				do not believe there seems to be any. (The number of years is 
				likely to small for there to be any observable intrayear 
				seasonality, anyway.) Overall, I think the spiral choice 
				lacks sufficient motivation for it to be implemented: 
				I think it would be better for time to a simple 1D linear 
				dimension like in a typical line chart. The way the 
				visualization is now, the reader is required to move their 
				eyes in circles and is more likely to jump around different 
				time periods with their eyes. In addition, one should note that 
				the length of the curve corresponding to a fixed time period 
				(e.g. 3 months) is actually increasing as time goes on. That is, 
				time gets more and more stretched as time increases. 
				Furthermore, this rate of stretching is nonconstant since 
				sometimes the curvature is that of a circle centered at the 
				origin and sometimes the distance from the origin is increasing. 
				These inconsistencies do not make sense, in my opinion, and 
				they add unnecessary complexity to the chart. I do not see 
				what would be lost by switching to a simple linear line chart.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="../../images/a3_sketch1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The above plot is a re-iteration of the original 
					visualization as a simpler line plot. Here, time is 
					1-dimnesional and uniform (not stretching). The original 
					article publication date is labeled, which corresponds
					to the date that the original spiral chart stops at. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					As discussed in my critique, I believed that switching to a 
					line plot would reduce unnecessary complexity, so that is what 
					I did. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I think this plot was a successful improvement over the 
					original visualization by simply being simpler and easier to 
					read, without losing any important communicating features. 
					The three "waves" of new covid cases are more clearly
					represented, as are some additional mini-waves.
				</li>
				<li>
					One possible advantage of the spiral plot is that it 
					covers more distance for a comparable area. That is, the 
					black line (which represents the time axis) in the original 
					plot is much longer, so I want to experiment with possible ways 
					to lengthen this axis without just making a super wide 
					line plot that wouldn't look good in a browser.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="../../images/a3_sketch2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The plot above is a series of line plots that is a re-iteration 
					of the first sketch. It essentially jsut breaks up the plot 
					into three separate plots, one for each year, where each 
					plot begins at the previous year's December and ends at the 
					next year's January 6. In particular, the original visualization's 
					ending date (January 6, 2022) is labeled on the second plot as the 
					ending.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I wanted to see if I could stretch out the time dimension 
					more and if this would allow the viewer to observe more 
					detail. I also wanted to see if I could make the original 
					ending date a more clear "end" while still incporating data 
					from after that date in the 2022 graph.
				</li>
				<li>
					I also thought it could expose any intrayear seasonality that 
					I may have missed from the original visualization. There wasn't any 
					to be seen, however. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I think I was successful in separating data by the date 2022-01-06, 
					but there is also a somewhat arbitrary time split at the start of 
					2021. In addition, the ease of reading is worse than expected; I do 
					not like how the different time periods seem so discretely separated 
					even with the small amount of overlap. Comparing height of the 
					lines between the graphs is also slightly harder than before, and the 
					eye isn not drawn to the peak in January 2022 as much anymore
					(since it is represnted twice, which is akward).
				</li>
				<li>
					In general, I think splitting the time periods introduces more 
					downsides than upsides. In the next sketch, I want to explore 
					different scaling methods than linear scaling.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="../../images/a3_sketch3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A reiteration of the first sketch using log-scale. The 
					log of the 7-day rolling average of daily new Covid cases
					is plotted over time, where we start the graph when the 
					number of new daily covid cases is above 1000. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I was wondering if plotting in log-scale could reveal some 
					patterns or trends not seen before in the linear scale.
				</li>
				<li>
					The log-scale sketch seems to equally emphasis peaks and 
					troughs, so that the three discrete waves from before are 
					no longer as emphasized. While lows of daily new covid cases 
					could be interesting to look at, I believe the waves/peaks 
					are a bit more important to communicate, since this is the 
					thing that is trying to be prevented.
				</li>
				<li>
					Also, the log-scale makes the highest peak in January 2022 
					seem much less dramatic. I am not sure, but I feel that it 
					could mislead viewers by suggesting that the new wave of 
					Omicron cases is not that much more signficiant than 
					previous waves.
				</li>
				<li>
					Overall, I think that the first sketch is still better, 
					and the only concern I have is that about making the 
					the new case data from after the publication of the 
					original article visually different from the data that
					is shared with that visualization.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>
			<figure>

			<div style="text-align:center;">
				<button id="toggleBtn" onclick="toggleChart()">Hide Future Case Counts</button>
				
				<div class="chart-box">
					<img id="imgPartial" src="../../images/covid_cases_before_pub_date.png" alt="Partial Data" class="hidden">
					
					<img id="imgFull" src="../../images/covid_cases_full_range.png" alt="Full Data">
				</div>
			</div>

			<script>
				function toggleChart() {
				const partial = document.getElementById('imgPartial');
				const full = document.getElementById('imgFull');
				const btn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn');

				if (full.classList.contains('hidden')) {
					full.classList.remove('hidden');
					partial.classList.add('hidden');
					btn.innerText = "Hide Future Case Counts";
				} else {
					full.classList.add('hidden');
					partial.classList.remove('hidden');
					btn.innerText = "Show Future Case Counts";
				}
				}
			</script>
      
			
				<figcaption>
					The plot above is essentially a refurbished version of 
					sketch 1 that I created using Datawrapper. The button
					allows the viewer to switch between a figure that only 
					goes up until the date of publication of the original 
					visualization (so that it uses the exact same set of 
					data) and a figure that goes through the first quarter of 
					2022. This allows the viewer to compare the realization 
					of the Covid situation with predictions made by modelers 
					in January 2022.

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
				In my final design, I essentially just converted the original 
				visualization into a simpler line plot where time is 
				linear and one-dimensional. I believe that this simpler and more
				conventioanl line chart allows for the viewer to easier 
				observe the severity of the Omicron variant's spike in 
				new cases in January 2022 and compare it to previous spikes 
				in new case numbers. I also included some annotations 
				and a button that allows for viewers to either view the same 
				exact data that was used in that original visualizaiton or 
				gain insight into what realized after the original visualizaiton 
				was released. This could be useful for direct comparison 
				with the original figure vs. trying to gain more insight about 
				the early 2022 Omicron spike. I also made the line become a 
				different color after this publication date, so that it is 
				clear on the longer-horizon chart where the new data 
				comes in. I used the same measure in the 
				original visualizaiton (a 7-day rolling average) since I 
				believe that this already sufficiently reduces weekly seasonality 
				and random noise to provide the most insight. Laslty, I 
				decided to make a minor addition of an annotation that shows 
				the origin of the Omicron variant, just so that the major 
				January 2022 spike can be appropriately associated with 
				the Omicron variant. That is, I am trying to tell the story 
				that this new large spike, which is larger than any other 
				spike seen before, is caused by Omicron.
			</p>

			<p>
				In my original critique, my main issue was with the spiral 
				design choice and how that does not appropriately represent 
				the time dimension. I believe that my more simple visualization 
				solves these problems by reducing complexity and allowing 
				for easier viewing while also making the passage of time 
				more uniform and intuitive. One thing that I did lose by doing 
				so was the lack of length/space on a linear line chart. 
				I had the idea of splitting the line chart up into a series 
				of vertically stacked charts, but this did not work out as 
				well as I hoped for. I also believe that this isn't a big 
				problem since I do not think there are a ton of super 
				important lower time scale observations, nor do I think such 
				observations would be super relevant.
