    <h1>Maxwell Sun</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at MIT studying math and 
        computer science with a focus on machine learning (double major
        in course 18 and 6-4, in MIT lingo). After graduation, I will be 
        working in a proprietary trading firm in Miami. In my free time, 
        I like to go to the gym, eat tasty food, and hang out with my 
        buddies. I am a proud brother of Theta Chi's beta chapter.
